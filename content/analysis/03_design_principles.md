Design principles
==========================

The purpose of this small report is to analyze three websites. The main focus will be the design principles.  

Selection
-----------------------

The personal pages I have chosen all represent current or former Swedish elite athletes. I chose these partly because I admire them all, but also because I found it difficult to find strict personal pages, so I simply took some I could find.

### Web sites

#### Martin Ponsiluoma
_An active biathlete. Visit the webiste [here](https://www.martinponsiluoma.se/)_

#### André Myhrer
_A former alpine ski racer. Visit the webiste [here](https://www.andremyhrer.com/)_

Method
-----------------------

To carry out the analysis, I will use guidelines from the article [Design elements and principles](https://www.canva.com/learn/design-elements-principles/) as well as from the book [The Principles of Beautiful Web Design](https://dbwebb.se/kunskap/boken-the-principles-of-beautiful-web-design).

Results
-----------------------

#### Martin Ponsiluoma
##### Purpose
The purpose of this website is to promote and give background info about Ponsiluoma and his sponsors.

##### Design and characteristics
In general, the website is filled with blue and white elements. Looking at the website, it's clear that sponsors, partners and links to his social platforms are in focus. 
##### Design benefits and feeling
The blue and white elements mediates a familiar feeling that makes you think of winter and snow, which feels more than natural in this case. One thing that threw me off a bit is the _very_ big and zoomed image at the top, perhaps they took it one step to far? But then again, biathlon is a lot about focus and maybe that's what they wanted to capture and show here. I'm a bit unsure whether I think they succeeded or not though.

##### Design principle(s)
One of the most prominent design elements is what seems to be parallax scrolling. Another element that stands out, due to the lack of it, is hover effects. When hovering over a link in the menu or a sponsor logo, the only indication that you can click on the element is that the cursor changes to a pointer. Maybe, at least the links, could have had something more that makes it clear what you are pointing at.

As for different design on different pages, this website really is just one page and therefore it has not been possible analyze.

#### André Myhrer
##### Purpose
The purpose of this website is to promote and give background info about Myhrer. There are not as many sponsors present on Myhrer's page, which could be explained by the fact that he is no longer active. It seems this site is more about promoting Myhrer and his accomplishments.

##### Design and characteristics
Just like we saw on Ponsiluoma's site, this website is also filled with blue and white elements, here along with warmer tones at the end of the landing page.

##### Design benefits and feeling

In general, the website feels very welcoming, energetic and happy. The image at the top is very well displayed and makes you want to scroll down to see even more.

##### Design principle(s)
As for design principles, there a few I noticed. One being how the title blends in with the snow in the top image. It gives some texture to the text. Other elements that stand out are lines. Here they seem to have worked with angles that create almost like an arrow pointing down, making it very logial to keep scrolling that direction.

As for subpages there is only one, which provides very short information about business inquiries. The design is there very simple but neat. Interestingly, there is a banner at the top referring to discount on shop items, which seems to be a broken link leading to a non-existent page. 

#### Sara Hector
##### Purpose
The purpose of this website is to promote and give background info about Hector and her sponsors.

##### Design and characteristics
Again we have a website filled with blue and white elements, there seems to be a pattern - winter sports and blue elements! Looking at the website, sponsors, partners and links to social platforms are in focus. Just as in Ponsiluoma's case, this is an active athlete, making it very logical that sponsors and such are in focus.

##### Design benefits and feeling
Just like on Myhrer's page, the image at the top is an active image where the snow creates a feeling of a bit of texture. As said earlier, the blue colors fit well with the purpose of this type of website.

##### Design principle(s)
I would say the most prominent design principle on this site is lines, horizontal ones that clearly divides each section into a block on its own. There is also a bit of a recurring pattern, where the sponsor banner and her logo appears more than once.

The subpages have a common denominator, the dark blue header and footer and primarily white background with plain text in the main part. The sponsor and "How?" pages offer some variation, with blue block elements, which provide some contrast. The latter also seems to have been created with balance in mind, creating logical steps to follow to "walk" down the list of achievements and events.

Analysis
-----------------------

#### Conclusions
Looking at the three web pages studied, it seems that a very large picture of the person is a common way to introduce the page. As discussed earlier, for this subgroup - skiers - blue seems to be a common color of choice. 

Looking at the three web pages studied, it seems that a very large picture of the person is a common way to introduce the page. As discussed earlier, for this subgroup - skiers - blue seems to be a common color of choice. For the active two, the feeling is that the main focus is promoting their sponsors, and perhaps they haven't put much focus on unique desing elements for that reason. They both, Myhrer too, have pretty standard design with blocks and lines, but nothing too fancy or mind-blowing. 

My own portfolio
-----------------------
### Analysis

##### Design and characteristics
The website is very simple in its design. The color scheme is a monochromatic one with a blue base color. There are some lines and blocks, but no really unique designs that stand out.

##### Design benefits and feeling
I would say that the site reflects exactly what it is - a site designed by someone who has not previously studied design principles. In this way, it is also representative, it shows an example of what a website can look like in the beginner stages where there is some knowledge of various principles - but where there is even more to learn before it could be used commercially.

##### Design principle(s)
The design principles are basically the same throughout the website. There are some lines that create divisions and separate for example the footer from  the other contents. Some blocks (in analysis and technologies) have rounded corners to create a smoother feel.
The only page that stands out in any way is the gallery, where the images have been given a shadow to create a more prominent feel.

### Suggestions for updates
Seeing examples and reading about design principles, it would probably be a good idea to try and implement some more shadows and non-horizontal lines. A better balance (on the home page for example) would probably also be preferable.

### Implemented updates
 o Positioned image next to text on home page, rather than below it as before.  
 o Updated all images to have the same design as the ones in the gallery, using _box-shadow_. This makes the website feel less 'flat' and puts the images in nice focus when hovering over them.
 o Added a wave design to the footer, to get less horizontal lines.
