Colors
==========================

The purpose of this small report is to analyze three websites. The main focus will be the colors on the website.  
To narrow it down a bit, and be able to compare the three in some sense, I have chosen to only look at the first impression - the landing pages.

Selection
-----------------------

The web sites I have chosen all fall under the same category - exercise. Since I use them all myself and they all have a common denominator, I thought it would be interesting to have a closer look at them.

### Web sites

[Zwift](https://www.zwift.com/) - mainly a site for indoor cycling (but also used for running).

[Styrkelabbet](https://www.styrkelabbet.se/) - a site focusing on strength training, but also research related to health.

[Strava](https://www.strava.com/) - a site for tracking and analyzing your training.

Method
-----------------------

To carry out the analysis, I will use the browser's 'inspect' tool. I will also use [ColorZilla](https://www.colorzilla.com/) to retrieve colors from the web pages.  
Finally, I will use Abobe's [Color wheel](https://color.adobe.com/sv/create/color-wheel) to further analyze the colors.

Results
-----------------------

### Zwift

_Zwift front page, divided into three. Click on the image to view the original snapshot._

Above is a snapshot of the entire front page of the website. However, the first image on the page is in motion, alternating between a more orange toned image, a more pink toned image, and an image with more green, blue and graey tones. The latter two can be seen below.

**Color palette**

The colors picked up by [ColorZilla](https://www.colorzilla.com/) are as follows
<table class="palette">
    <tr>
        <td class="zwift-color1">
        <td class="zwift-color2">
        <td class="zwift-color3">
        <td class="zwift-color4">
        <td class="zwift-color5">
        <td class="zwift-color6">
        <td class="zwift-color7">
        <td class="zwift-color8">
        <td class="zwift-color9">
    </tr>
</table>

In this palette, it can be seen that the main colors are a pacific blue nuance, as well as a orange color. The other colors used are of white, grey and black shades, and are therefore not considered actual colors (for the purposes of this analysis). 
Based on the blue and orange color, it is likely that the website is using a split complemenatary color scheme, or perhaps even a double split complemenatary scheme, if we consider the alternating pink image at the top.
Looking at the website, there are also a few different shades of blue involved, although most of these are embedded in the images on the website.

The fonts used on the website are primarily their own fonts **ZwiftSprint-Black** (for headers) and **ZwiftFondo-Regular** (for body text).  
Both of these are used as part of a font family with Helvetica, Arial and sans-serif as fallbacks.

The site as a whole gives off an impression of energy and joy, which I think is exactly what they are trying to achieve.

### Styrkelabbet

[![slImg](%assets_url%/img/slpage.png){.sl-img}](%assets_url%/img/slfullpage.png)
_Strykelabbet front page, divided into three. Click on the image to view the original snapshot._

Above is a snapshot of the entire front page of the website. At first glance, you can see that the only color that really stand out (apart from those embedded in images) is a shade of red.

**Color palette**

The colors picked up by [ColorZilla](https://www.colorzilla.com/) are as follows

<table class="palette">
<tr>
<td class="sl-color1">
<td class="sl-color2">
<td class="sl-color3">
<td class="sl-color4">
<td class="sl-color5">
<td class="sl-color6">
<td class="sl-color7">
<td class="sl-color8">
<td class="sl-color9">
<td class="sl-color10">
<td class="sl-color11">
<td class="sl-color12">
<td class="sl-color13">
<td class="sl-color14">
<td class="sl-color15">
<td class="sl-color16">
</tr>
</table>

In this palette, it can be seen that the main colors are a darker red nuance, two shades of blue as well as a green shade. The blue colors are not very visible on the page though and are probably not that widely used. The brighter one of them can be found in the footer, while the darker one seems hidden at first glance. One possible use could be for pop-ups or other similar functions. 
The green shade is seen once, at the very top, for a "sign up"-button. The other colors used are of white, grey and black shades, and are therefore not considered actual colors (for the purposes of this analysis).
Based on the primarily red color, it would be likely that the website is using a monochromatic color scheme. However, considering the green color of the submit button, it suggests a complementary color scheme.

It appears that more or less the whole websites uses the same font family, regardless of the type of text. These fonts are used within the font family:  
_-apple-system  
system-ui  
BlinkMacSystemFont  
Segoe UI  
Helvetica  
Arial  
sans-serif  
Apple Color Emoji  
Segoe UI Emoji  
Segoe UI Symbol_

One part of the website that stands out in this sense, is the very first box, where the font family is limited to _Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif_ and the header is _Damion_. The only other part that stand out is the "cookies"-box in the footer, where the font family is _Roboto, Arial_.

The site as a whole gives a fairly simple and calm impression, there is nothing that stands out massively. 

### Strava

[![stravaImg](%assets_url%/img/stravapage.png){.strava-img}](%assets_url%/img/stravafullpage.png)
_Strava front page, divided into two. Click on the image to view the original snapshot._

Above is a snapshot of the entire front page of the website. At first glance, you can see that the only color that really stand out is a shade of orange.
The smaller image, in the black section, is a slideshow of different views from the app.

**Color palette**

The colors picked up by [ColorZilla](https://www.colorzilla.com/) are as follows
<table class="palette">
    <tr>
        <td class="strava-color1">
        <td class="strava-color2">
        <td class="strava-color3">
        <td class="strava-color4">
        <td class="strava-color5">
        <td class="strava-color6">
        <td class="strava-color7">
        <td class="strava-color8">
        <td class="strava-color9">
        <td class="strava-color10">
        <td class="strava-color11">
    </tr>
</table>

In this palette you can see that the main colors are two different shades of red orange. The other colors used are of white, grey and black shades, and are therefore not considered actual colors (for the purposes of this analysis). 
Based on the stronger red orange color, as well as the lighter shade of it, it is likely that the website is using a monochromatic color scheme, where the lighter shade of red orange is simply a lighter shade of the darker one. Possibly, it could be an analogous color scheme, but the lighter shade falls a bit outside that scheme.

It appears this websites also uses pretty much the same font-family through out the whole site, regardless of the type of text. These fonts are used within the font family:  
_MaisonNeue  
Segoe UI   
Helvetica Neue   
-apple-system   
system-ui   
BlinkMacSystemFont   
Roboto   
Arial   
sans-serif   
Apple Color Emoji   
Segoe UI Emoji   
Segoe UI Symbol_

One part of the website that stands out in this sense, is the middle section, where the font family is limited to _MaisonNeueMono, Consolas, Monaco, "Lucida Console", Courier, monospace_.

The site gives a clean and simple impression. It looks neat and the fact that the middle section has a different font gives a nice look to the page.

Analysis
-----------------------

### Zwift

The website leaves an impression that matches what you would expect from a website that promotes exercise.  
The fact that they use clear colors that stand out from black, white and grey gives a sense of energy and happiness.

### Styrkelabbet

By knowing a little bit about the company and the website, I know that the primarily focus is to deliver evidence-based articles and information. And with an emphasis on _articles_, I think the design and colors work. It gives a clean feeling where the content itself is in focus.

### Strava

The website has a quite simple but nice look. It is not very colorful on its own, but the alternating images and moving bar (showing compatible devices) bring life to it. 

### General

It is interesting to see that both Strava and Zwift uses a shade of orange, perhaps there is some psychology behind it. But without diving to deep into that part - psychology or not - the orange shades work. It gives life to the site and, from my point of view at least, an energetic impression.
